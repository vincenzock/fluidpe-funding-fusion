  }, {
    question: "How does a loan against mutual funds work?",
    answer: "When you take a loan against mutual funds, you pledge your mutual fund units as collateral. Your units are marked with a lien in favor of Fluidpe, but you retain ownership. You can borrow up to 80% of the value of your eligible mutual funds. Interest rates start from just 8.5% per annum. You continue to enjoy all benefits from your mutual funds, including any appreciation or dividends."
  }, {
    question: "What are the benefits of taking a loan against mutual funds with Fluidpe?",
    answer: "Benefits include: Lower interest rates (starting at 8.5%) compared to personal loans and credit cards, no need to sell your investments, retain all benefits including market appreciation and dividends, 100% digital process with quick approval and disbursement, flexible repayment options, and no prepayment penalties."
  }, {
    question: "What mutual funds can I pledge for a loan?",
    answer: "You can pledge equity funds, debt funds, balanced/hybrid funds, and ETFs for a loan with Fluidpe. The exact list of eligible funds may vary based on current market conditions and our risk assessment policies. Debt funds and large-cap equity funds generally have higher loan-to-value ratios compared to mid or small-cap funds."
  }, {
    question: "How long does it take to get a loan disbursed?",
    answer: "With Fluidpe's fully digital process, you can get your loan disbursed within 24 hours of completing the application and documentation requirements. The process involves online verification of your mutual fund holdings, digital signing of loan agreements, and direct disbursement to your bank account."
  }, {
    question: "Is there a minimum or maximum loan amount?",
    answer: "Yes, at Fluidpe, the minimum loan amount is â‚¹1 lakh and the maximum can go up to â‚¹5 crores, depending on the value and type of mutual funds in your portfolio."
  }, {
    question: "What happens if the value of my pledged mutual funds falls?",
    answer: "If the value of your pledged mutual funds falls below a certain threshold (typically 120-130% of the loan amount), you'll receive a margin call asking you to either pledge additional funds or partially repay the loan to maintain the required margin. Our team will guide you through the process if this occurs."
  }, {
    question: "Can I continue to earn returns on pledged mutual funds?",
    answer: "Yes, even when your mutual funds are pledged, you continue to receive all dividends, interest, and other benefits from your pledged mutual funds. The funds remain in your name, and only a lien is marked in favor of Fluidpe. Market appreciation in your fund value is also to your benefit."
  }, {
    question: "What are the repayment options available?",
    answer: "Fluidpe offers multiple repayment options including interest-only payments with bullet repayment of principal at the end of tenure, equated monthly installments (EMI), and flexible repayment schedules based on your cash flow. You can also prepay the loan anytime without any penalties."
  }, {
    question: "What documents are required to apply for a loan against mutual funds?",
    answer: "You'll need basic KYC documents (PAN card, Aadhaar card, address proof), bank account details for disbursement, and details of the mutual funds you wish to pledge. The entire documentation process is digital, and you can upload all required documents through our secure platform."
